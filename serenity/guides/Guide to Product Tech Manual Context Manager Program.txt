Product Tech Manual: Context Manager Program for the Serenity Project
Overview

Product Name: Context Manager Program

Version: 1.0.8

Created: 2025-03-26

Updated: 2025-03-27

Developed by: Serenity Project Team, with support from Grok (xAI)

Purpose: The Context Manager Program is a Python-based automation system designed to 
manage file updates, track versions, maintain a changelog, and log project memory updates. It ensures consistency 
across project files, provides crash recovery, and generates summaries for project continuity. The program is 
a suite of scripts and files working together to streamline project management.
What the Program Does

The Context Manager Program automates the process of updating and managing project files. 

It:

    Takes a session summary (session_summary.md) as input, which specifies updates to code files, changelog entries, memory 
	log updates, and action items.
    Updates code files (e.g., gui/interface.py) with new content or method changes.
    Tracks file versions in versions.json to ensure updates are applied to the correct version.
    Maintains a project log (PROJECT_LOG.md) with a changelog and memory log for tracking changes and project history.
    Locks files during updates to prevent conflicts using locks.json.
    Monitors for crashes and restores files if a crash occurs (via crash_monitor.py).
    Generates a context summary (context_summary.md) as output, summarizing the project state and next steps.
    Logs all actions in context_manager.log and crash_monitor.log for debugging and auditing.

This program ensures that the project remains consistent, recoverable, and well-documented, even in a collaborative 
environment with multiple updates.
Program Components

The Context Manager Program consists of several scripts and files that work together:

    Scripts:
        context_manager.py:
            The core script that processes session_summary.md and applies updates to project files.
            Manages file locking, version tracking, changelog updates, memory log updates, and context summary generation.
            Version: 1.0.8.
        crash_monitor.py:
            A companion script that monitors context_manager.py for crashes.
            If a crash occurs, it restores files from backups and resets the transaction state.
            Version: 1.0.0.
    Input Files:
        session_summary.md:
            The input file that specifies updates to be applied.
            Contains sections for metadata, code updates, changelog updates, memory log updates, and action items.
            Example format:
            markdown

        Used for restoring files if a crash occurs.

How the Program Works

The Context Manager Program operates as a workflow to process updates and maintain project consistency. Here’s how it works:

    Input Processing:
        The user creates or updates session_summary.md with the desired changes (e.g., code updates, changelog entries).
        The file must follow the required format with sections for Metadata, Code Updates, Changelog Updates, Memory Log Updates, and 
		Action Items.
    Run the Program:
        Execute context_manager.py:
        text

        python context_manager.py
        context_manager.py starts and launches crash_monitor.py in the background to monitor for crashes.
    Validation and Locking:
        context_manager.py validates session_summary.md to ensure it has all required sections and correct formatting.
        It checks for file locks in locks.json to prevent concurrent updates. If a file is locked, the program exits with an error.
    Transaction Management:
        The program creates a transaction in transaction.json to track the update process (e.g., {"state": "started", "backups": {}}).
        It backs up all files to be updated (e.g., gui/interface.py, PROJECT_LOG.md) to the backups/ directory.
    Apply Updates:
        Code Updates: Updates files like gui/interface.py with new content or method changes. Increments the file version in versions.json.
        Changelog Updates: Adds entries to the Changelog section of PROJECT_LOG.md.
        Memory Log Updates: Adds entries to the Memory Log section of PROJECT_LOG.md and updates the Table of Contents.
        Version Tracking: Updates versions.json with the new file versions.
    Crash Monitoring:
        crash_monitor.py monitors the PID of context_manager.py.
        If context_manager.py crashes (i.e., the PID no longer exists and context_manager_done.signal is not present), crash_monitor.py:
            Restores files from backups using transaction.json.
            Clears locks in locks.json.
            Sets the transaction state to "failed".
    Generate Output:
        If the run completes successfully, context_manager.py generates context_summary.md with the project state and action items.
        It creates context_manager_done.signal to signal crash_monitor.py to shut down.
    Logging:
        All actions are logged in context_manager.log and crash_monitor.log for debugging and auditing.

Key Features

    Version Control: Tracks file versions in versions.json to ensure updates are applied to the correct version.
    Crash Recovery: Uses crash_monitor.py and backups to restore files if a crash occurs.
    File Locking: Prevents concurrent updates using locks.json.
    Changelog and Memory Log: Maintains a detailed history of changes and project notes in PROJECT_LOG.md.
    Automation: Processes updates automatically from session_summary.md, reducing manual errors.
    Context Summary: Generates context_summary.md for project continuity and collaboration.

How to Use the Program

    Prepare the Session Summary:
        Edit session_summary.md with the desired updates (code changes, changelog entries, etc.).
        Ensure it follows the required format with all sections.
    Run the Program:
        Open a terminal in the project directory (G:/project/test).
        Run:
        text

    python context_manager.py
    The program will process session_summary.md, apply updates, and generate context_summary.md.

Check the Output:

    Review context_summary.md for the updated project state and action items.
    Check context_manager.log and crash_monitor.log for any errors.

Handle Crashes:

    If a crash occurs, crash_monitor.py will restore files automatically.
    Rerun context_manager.py to retry the updates.

Additional Commands:

    List file versions:
    text

python context_manager.py list-versions
List file locks:
text
python context_manager.py list-locks
Reset versions or locks (if needed):
text

        python context_manager.py reset-versions
        python context_manager.py reset-locks

System Requirements

    Operating System: Windows (tested on Windows with paths like G:/project/test).
    Python Version: Python 3.8 or higher.
    Dependencies:
        psutil (automatically installed by context_manager.py if missing).

Limitations and Known Issues (as of Version 1.0.8)

    File Locking Issues: The program may fail if a file is locked and not released properly (e.g., due to a crash). Locks must be manually 
	cleared using reset-locks.
    Version Mismatches: If a crash occurs after incrementing a version in versions.json but before completing the update, the version may 
	become out of sync with the file content.
    Manual Version Updates: The version in file headers (e.g., gui/interface.py) is not automatically updated when versions.json is updated.
    Crash Recovery: While crash_monitor.py restores files, it may leave transaction.json in a "failed" state, requiring manual correction.

Future Improvements

    Add a timeout mechanism for file locks to automatically release stale locks.
    Update file headers automatically when incrementing versions in versions.json.
    Enhance crash_monitor.py to set the transaction state to "idle" after successful cleanup.
    Implement an error testing suite to identify and fix additional issues.
