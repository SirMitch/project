Guide to the Context Summary (context_summary.md) for the Context Manager Program
Clarification on Roles of session_summary.md and context_summary.md

You’re correct in your understanding, but let’s clarify the roles to ensure there’s no confusion:

    session_summary.md:
        This is the input file that you (the user) create or receive from the chatbot (e.g., Grok).
        It contains the updates you want to apply to the project, such as code changes, changelog entries, memory log updates, and action 
		items.
        The chatbot may provide a session_summary.md as part of its response, which you save and use as input for the Context Manager Program.
    context_summary.md:
        This is the output file generated by context_manager.py after processing the session_summary.md.
        It summarizes the current state of the project after the updates, including metadata, the previous session summary’s memory log 
		entries, the project’s file structure, files to provide back to the chatbot, and action items for the next steps.
        You return this file to the chatbot (e.g., the next Grok in a new chat) to provide context about the project’s state and to receive 
		further instructions or updates.

In summary:

    Chatbot → You: The chatbot provides a session_summary.md with updates to apply.
    You → Program: You run context_manager.py with the session_summary.md as input.
    Program → You: The program generates a context_summary.md as output.
    You → Chatbot: You provide the context_summary.md back to the chatbot for the next steps.

What is the Context Summary?

The context_summary.md file is the output of the Context Manager Program, generated by context_manager.py after successfully processing 
a session_summary.md. It serves as a snapshot of the project’s state, providing:

    Metadata about the session (e.g., timestamp, previous session details).
    A record of the previous session’s memory log entries for continuity.
    The current file structure of the project.
    A list of files to provide back to the chatbot for review.
    Action items for the next steps in the project.

This file is crucial for maintaining project continuity, especially in a collaborative environment where multiple team members or chatbots 
(like Grok) are involved.
How the Context Summary Works

    Generated by context_manager.py:
        After processing the updates in session_summary.md, the program creates context_summary.md to document the results.
        It includes information about what was done and the current state of the project.
    Used for Collaboration:
        You provide context_summary.md to the chatbot (e.g., the next Grok) to show the project’s current state.
        The chatbot uses this information to understand what updates were applied, what files to review, and what tasks to assign next.
    Purpose:
        Ensures continuity by summarizing the project’s state after each session.
        Provides a clear list of files to share with the chatbot for further analysis or updates.
        Assigns action items to guide the next steps in the project.

Required Information and Structure

The context_summary.md file is automatically generated by context_manager.py and follows a strict structure with specific sections. Below, 
I’ll explain each section, its purpose, and provide a detailed example.

    Header:
        Starts with # Context Summary on the first line.
        Identifies the file as a context summary.
    Metadata Section:
        Header: ## Metadata
        Content: A list of key-value pairs providing context about the session.
        Fields:
            - **Timestamp**: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS (e.g., 2025-03-27 10:00:00)
            - **Previous Message Reference**: Reference ID (e.g., Test Message #5)
            - **Previous Session Summary Version**: Version number (Description) (e.g., 1.0 (Test))
        Purpose: Tracks when the context summary was generated and links it to the previous session summary.
    Previous Session Summary Section:
        Header: ## Previous Session Summary
        Content: The Memory Log Updates from the session_summary.md that was just processed, or None if there were no memory log updates.
        Purpose: Provides continuity by including the memory log entries from the previous session, ensuring that project context is preserved.
    File Structure Section:
        Header: ## File Structure
        Content: A list of all files in the project directory and its subdirectories (e.g., G:/project/test/).
        Format: Each file is listed as a bullet point with its full path (e.g., - G:/project/test/context_manager.py).
        Purpose: Documents the current state of the project’s file structure, helping the chatbot understand the project layout.
    Files to Provide Section:
        Header: ## Files to Provide
        Content: A list of files that were updated or are relevant for the chatbot to review.
        Format: Each file is listed as a bullet point with its full path (e.g., - G:/project/test/gui/interface.py).
        Purpose: Specifies which files you should provide to the chatbot for further analysis or verification.
    Action Items Section:
        Header: ## Action Items
        Content: A list of tasks or reminders for the next steps, copied from the session_summary.md and potentially augmented by the program.
        Format: Each item is listed as a bullet point (e.g., - Review updated stop method.).
        Purpose: Guides the next steps in the project, ensuring that tasks are clearly assigned.

Rules for Formatting

    The context_summary.md is generated by the program, so you don’t need to worry about formatting it manually.
    However, when providing it to the chatbot, ensure that the file is not modified (e.g., don’t add extra sections or change the content), 
	as the chatbot may rely on the exact structure.
    The sections must appear in the exact order: Metadata, Previous Session Summary, File Structure, Files to Provide, Action Items.

Example context_summary.md

Below is a detailed example of a context_summary.md file that would be generated by context_manager.py (version 1.0.8) after processing 
the session_summary.md example I provided earlier. I’ll include comments (in parentheses) to explain each part, but these comments 
should not be included in the actual file.

# Context Summary
(This is the first line, identifying the file as a context summary generated by context_manager.py.)

## Metadata
(This section provides context about the session that was just processed.)
- **Timestamp**: 2025-03-27 10:00:00
(The timestamp of when the context summary was generated, matching the timestamp from session_summary.md.)
- **Previous Message Reference**: Test Message #5
(The message reference from the session_summary.md, linking this context summary to the previous session.)
- **Previous Session Summary Version**: 1.0 (Test)
(The version of the session_summary.md that was processed, including the description.)

## Previous Session Summary
(This section includes the Memory Log Updates from the session_summary.md, or "None" if there were none.)
## Entry
### 2025-03-27
- Updated `stop` method in GUI interface for better error handling.
(This is the memory log entry from the session_summary.md, copied here to preserve project context.)

## File Structure
(This section lists all files in the project directory and its subdirectories.)
- G:/project/test/context_manager.py
- G:/project/test/crash_monitor.py
- G:/project/test/session_summary.md
- G:/project/test/context_summary.md
- G:/project/test/PROJECT_LOG.md

- G:/project/test/backups/PROJECT_LOG.md_20250327_100000.backup
(Each file is listed with its full path, showing the current state of the project directory.)

## Files to Provide
(This section lists files that were updated or are relevant for the chatbot to review.)
- G:/project/test/PROJECT_LOG.md
- G:/project/test/gui/interface.py
(These files were updated during the session: gui/interface.py had its stop method updated, and PROJECT_LOG.md had changelog and memory log 
entries added.)

## Action Items
(This section lists tasks for the next steps, copied from the session_summary.md.)
- Review updated `stop` method in `gui/interface.py`.
- Test GUI shutdown to ensure error handling works as expected.
(These action items were specified in the session_summary.md and are included here for the next steps.)
Explanation of the Example

    Header: The file starts with # Context Summary, identifying it as the output of context_manager.py.
    Metadata:
        Matches the metadata from the session_summary.md, providing context about the session that was processed.
    Previous Session Summary:
        Includes the Memory Log Updates from the session_summary.md, ensuring that the project’s context is preserved.
        If there were no memory log updates, this section would simply say None.
    File Structure:
        Lists all files in the project directory (G:/project/test/), including scripts, logs, state files, and backups.
        This helps the chatbot understand the project’s layout.
    Files to Provide:
        Lists PROJECT_LOG.md and gui/interface.py because they were updated during the session.
        You should provide these files to the chatbot (e.g., the next Grok) for review.
    Action Items:
        Copies the action items from the session_summary.md, ensuring that the next steps are clearly defined.

How to Use the Context Summary

    After Running context_manager.py:
        Open the generated context_summary.md file in the project directory (G:/project/test/context_summary.md).
        Review the file to understand the project’s current state and the action items.
    Provide to the Chatbot:
        Start a new chat with the next Grok.
        Share the context_summary.md file along with the files listed in the Files to Provide section (e.g., PROJECT_LOG.md, gui/interface.py).
        You can also share the tech manual and the session_summary.md guide to provide additional context.
    Follow Action Items:
        Complete the tasks listed in the Action Items section (e.g., review the updated stop method).
        The chatbot may provide a new session_summary.md with further updates based on the context_summary.md.

What Happens if You Modify the Context Summary?

    The context_summary.md is meant to be a read-only output file for documentation and collaboration.
    If you modify it (e.g., add extra sections or change the content), the chatbot may misinterpret the project’s state, leading to confusion 
	or incorrect updates.
    Always provide the file as generated by context_manager.py without modifications.

How context_summary.md Differs from session_summary.md

    Purpose:
        session_summary.md is the input, specifying updates to apply.
        context_summary.md is the output, summarizing the project state after the updates.
    Content:
        session_summary.md contains updates to apply (e.g., Code Updates, Changelog Updates).
        context_summary.md contains the results (e.g., File Structure, Files to Provide).
    Direction:
        session_summary.md goes from you (or the chatbot) to the program.
        context_summary.md goes from the program to you, and then to the chatbot.

Tips for Working with context_summary.md

    Check the Files to Provide: Always provide the listed files to the chatbot to ensure they have the latest updates.
    Review Action Items: Follow the action items to keep the project on track.
    Keep a Backup: Save a copy of context_summary.md in case you need to refer to it later.
    Share with the Tech Manual: When starting a new chat, share the context_summary.md along with the tech manual and session_summary.md 
	guide to provide full context.

Summary

The context_summary.md file is the output of the Context Manager Program, generated by context_manager.py after processing a 
session_summary.md. It summarizes the project’s state with sections for Metadata, Previous Session Summary, File Structure, 
Files to Provide, and Action Items. The example provided above is a complete, realistic context_summary.md that would be generated 
after processing the session_summary.md
