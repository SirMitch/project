Serenity Project Master Plan

This document unifies the design, development, and management processes for transforming a simple chatbot into an advanced, autonomous AI assistant—Serenity. It serves both as a comprehensive guide and a roadmap for achieving the project’s vision.
1. Project Vision and Objectives

Vision:
Evolve a basic chatbot into a full-featured, autonomous AI assistant—resembling systems like Alexa or Jarvis—that controls smart home devices, manages computer operations, integrates third-party hardware (e.g., 3D printers), and interacts naturally with users.

Key Objectives:

    Smart Home Control: Enable control over devices (lights, thermostats, etc.) with fast response times.

    Computer Control: Implement tasks such as launching applications, adjusting settings, and automating common computer tasks.

    Plugin Architecture: Develop a flexible system to add features (including hardware plugins) without overhauling the core code.

    Conversational Intelligence: Achieve natural, friendly dialogue with contextual awareness and personalization.

    Autonomy and Self-Improvement: Utilize iterative updates so that the system eventually manages its own development through automated feedback and session summaries.

2. Core Components and Their Roles
A. Chatbot Core and Serenity Evolution
